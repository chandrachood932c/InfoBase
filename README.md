**Problem Statement**

Despite the vital role that research plays in advancing knowledge and driving progress, the traditional systems of funding, creating, storing and accessing research papers and data sets are plagued by several significant problems. These problems include limited funding opportunities, inefficiencies in the research creation process, inadequate data storage and accessibility, poor communication and collaboration systems, and a lack of adequate incentives for researchers to share their findings and data sets. As a result, researchers face numerous barriers in conducting and disseminating their work, leading to a slower pace of discovery, inadequate utilization of research findings, and missed opportunities for collaboration and innovation. Addressing these challenges is critical to improving the quality and impact of research and to ensuring that the benefits of scientific advancements are widely shared and accessible to all.
